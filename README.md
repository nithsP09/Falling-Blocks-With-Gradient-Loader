Falling Blocks with Gradient Loader
This project demonstrates a colorful and animated loading effect featuring falling blocks with a gradient background. It uses CSS animations to create a visual effect where blocks appear to fall from the top of the screen, change colors, and repeat infinitely. The loader is centered on the page and is designed for aesthetic loading screens.

Features
1. Falling Block Animation: Blocks fall from the top and change opacity as they move down.
2. Gradient Background: Each block has a gradient background that transitions through different color schemes.
3. Infinite Animation Loop: The animation runs continuously, creating a dynamic and engaging effect.

Technologies Used
1. HTML: Structure of the webpage.
2. CSS: Styling and animation for the loader effect.
3. Flexbox: Used for centering the loader container in the middle of the screen.
4. CSS Keyframes: To create the animations for falling blocks and color change.
